Why is reflection important?

So that you can see how much you have accomplished well and what you need to work on for next time.

What did I do well this week?

Having good blocks of time working on the assignments. I've made helpful notes that are great to refer to.

What could I have done to improve?

I missed a few time recordings on toggl, and will work on making sure thats what I do first. I might also write down reasons I got stuck and how to get out of it in case I forget how I did it.
